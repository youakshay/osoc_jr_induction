The file git_commands.txt was different in main and new_branch branches as both had modified it and main had pushed those changes. 
main branch had the first statement as [[[edited from main branch]]]
new_branch branch had the first statement as (((edited from new_branch branch)))

this created a conflict while merging as main had pushed its changes
we resolved the conflict by opening the file in vs code and changed accordingly.

now this copy of file went to both the branches, thus solving the conflict.
then we committed and pushed the file from main branch
